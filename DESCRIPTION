Description: An analysis toolkit centered on genes. It mainly includes five
    features (search, conversion, analysis, plotting, and export).
    The user just needs to input feature id ('entrez', 'symbol', 'ensembl' or
    'uniprot') to retrieve feature information and PubMed records, to convert id
    types, to easily do enrichment analysis and publication-level plotting of GO,
    KEGG and GSEA, to plot group interaction and export result as
    excel sheets to easily share and communicate with others.
