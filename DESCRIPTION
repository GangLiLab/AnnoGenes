Description: An analysis toolkit based on the gene. It mainly includes five
    features (search, transform, analysis, visualization, and export).
    The user just needs to provide gene id ('entrez', 'symbol', 'ensembl' or 'uniprot') 
    then can search gene-related information, transform id type, do enrichment 
    analysis, visualize enrichment result, visualize multi-group overlap, 
    and export result as excel sheets to easily share and communicate with others.
