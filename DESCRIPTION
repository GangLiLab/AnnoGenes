    features (search, transform, analysis, visualization and export).
    User just needs to provide gene id ('entrez', 'symbol' or 'ensembl') then can 
    search gene related information, transform id type, do GSEA/GO/KEGG analysis,
    visualize enrichment result, visualized multi-group gene venn diagram and export
    result as excel sheets to easily share and communicate with others.
