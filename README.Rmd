# Genekitr

## Overview

**Genekitr** is a gene analysis toolkit based on R. It mainly contains five features:

- Search: gene-related information (exp. location, gene name, GC content, gene biotype ...) and PubMed records

- Convert: ID conversion among "Symbol & Alias", "NCBI Entrez", "Ensembl" and "Uniprot"

- Analysis: gene enrichment analysis including ORA (GO and KEGG) and GSEA which also supports multi-group comparison

- Plot: 14 GO plots, 7 KEGG plots, 5 GSEA plots and 2 Venn plots which support modification on text, color, border, axis and legend to make your own plot

- Export: easily export multiple data sets as various sheets in one excel file

## Why develop genekitr?

No matter what omics you analysis, genes are the basic research unit just like cells in our body. Genes issue is very common and a little tedious.

**Now let's welcome our host Mr.Doodle to introduce his daily work...**

##### Scene 1: repeat work

PI gave Doodle 30 gene and let him check their location (better with sequences) and detailed names. Doodle searched on NCBI one by one, copy & paste into excel. 1 hour later, Doodle sent the file to PI and PI smiled, "Well done! Now I have another 50!"

##### Scene 2: embarrassed name
PI gave Doodle a differential expression analysis matrix and a target gene list file. PI let him find if target gene is up-regulated after treatment. After a while, Doodle found there is no PDL1 gene in the matrix but indeed exists in the gene list. "Do we actually have PDL1 gene?" he asked PI and PI smiled, "Of course! You need to check gene CD274 instead of PDL1, which is just an alias!" Doodle was confused: how to distinguish from real gene name and alias?

##### Scene 3: 




- Many gene alias could not be recognized. For example, BCC7(human) is actually TP53; Tp53(mouse) is actually Trp53, Trp53inp2 & Ano9. Many popular gene symbol like PD1/PDL1 has own gene ID PDCD1/CD274, which could be omitted in downstream analysis.

- Some popular gene ID transforming package only support dozens of model species. But here we support 190 species 

- Some R package sets many arguments as input, but we only use simplest argument. For example, user only need to input gene ID then the function will determine gene type automatically.

- Keep updating annotating resource with online database (Ensembl & Uniprot). For now, we use the current Ensemble v104.

- Some package exports result as an object which not frendly for users to export and share with others. We export the analysis results as dataframes which could easily share and plot.   

- Built in plotting functions could produce pre-published figures then users only need to simply modify using AI.

```

## Quick guide

To quickly go through the package usage, we will use built-in gene list from GEO airway

([GSE52778](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52778)) DEG analysis.

### Search 

##### Search gene related information

`org` argument could accept fullname or shortname of specific organism. For example, we could 

use common name: `human/hs/hg/hsa` to describe human.

```{r geninfo}
library(genekitr)
library(dplyr)
data(geneList)
id = names(geneList)[1:100]
head(id)
ginfo = genInfo(id, org = 'human')
dplyr::as_tibble(head(ginfo))
```

##### Get specific type genes

For example, we want to retrieve all human protein-coding ids. Just leave argument `id` empty.

```{r}
pro_hg = genInfo(org = 'human') %>% 
  dplyr::filter(gene_biotype  == 'protein_coding') %>% dplyr::pull(symbol)
head(pro_hg) 
# number of human protein id
length(pro_hg)
```


##### Search gene PubMed records

```{r genpubmed}
pub = genPubmed(
  id = c("Cyp2c23", "Fhit", "Gal3st2b","Insl3", "Gbp4"),
  keywords = "stem cell", field = "tiab")
dplyr::as_tibble(head(pub))
```


### Transform

Regardless of input ID type, function will detect automatically.

User only need to specify which type you want, the left things just give `transId`.

##### Transform ID from entrezid to symbol

```{r transid}
id[1:5]
transId(id[1:5], trans_to = 'symbol',org='hs')
```

##### Transform gene alias
```{r alias}
transId(c('BCC7','PDL1','PD1'), trans_to = 'symbol',org='human')

# We could get all matched id when one-to-many occurs
transId(c('BCC7','PDL1','PD1'), trans_to = 'symbol',org='hg',unique = F)
```

##### Transform protein id to gene id
```{r}
# to symbol
transId(c('Q12879','Q86V25','Q8N386','Q5T7N3'),'sym','hs')
# to ensembl
transId(c('Q12879','Q86V25','Q8N386','Q5T7N3'),'ens','hs')
```

##### Transform ensembl id to symbol 
```{r}
transId(c('ENSG00000146006','ENSG00000134321','ENSG00000136267','ENSG00000105989'),'sym','hg')
```

##### Transform ensembl id to protein id

```{r}
transId(c('ENSG00000146006','ENSG00000134321','ENSG00000136267','ENSG00000105989'),'uniprot','hg')
```



### Analysis 

All enrichment analysis ** just give a gene list ** (especially GSEA need the gene list with a decreasing fold change)

#### over representation analysis (ORA)

##### GO analysis 

User could choose ontology among "bp", "cc", "mf" or "all".

If set `use_symbol = TRUE`, the result will return gene symbol for easy understanding.

If you are not sure the organism name, please type `biocOrg_name` and choose full name or short name

```{r warning=FALSE}
ego_bp = genGO(id[1:100], org = 'human', ont = 'bp',pvalueCutoff = 0.05,qvalueCutoff = 0.05, use_symbol = T)

# user could choose all three ontology
ego_all = genGO(id[1:100], org = 'human', ont = 'all',pvalueCutoff = 0.05,qvalueCutoff = 0.05, use_symbol = T)

```

##### KEGG analysis 

If you are not sure the organism name, please type `keggOrg_name` and choose full name or short name

```{r}
ekeg = genKEGG(id, org = 'hg',use_symbol = T)

# If we want to compare different groups of genes, we only need to add a gene group list
group = list(groupA = c(rep("up",50),rep("down",50)),
             groupB = c(rep("A",30), rep("B",70)))
ekeg_compare =  genKEGG(c(head(id,50),tail(id,50)), group_list = group,
                    org = 'human',pvalueCutoff = 0.15,qvalueCutoff = 0.15, use_symbol = T)
```

#### gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis 

`category` argument could choose from 'C1','C2','C3', 'C4','C5','C6','C7','C8' and 'H'

If you are not sure `subcategory`, you can only choose `category` and leave `subcategory` as blank. 

The message will tell what options you could choose in the main `category`.

```{r}
egsea = genGSEA(genelist = geneList,org = 'hs', 
                category = "H",
                use_symbol = T, pvalueCutoff = 1)
```


### Visulaize 

##### Gene overlap

If we only have two or three groups of genes, the function will plot Venn diagram;

If we have at least four groups of genes, the default option will be UpSet diagram.

```{r venn, fig.height = 4}
# if only have three groups
set1 <- paste0(rep("gene", 100), sample(c(1:1000), 100))
set2 <- paste0(rep("gene", 100), sample(c(1:1000), 100))
set3 <- paste0(rep("gene", 100), sample(c(1:1000), 100))
sm_gene_list <- list(gset1 = set1, gset2 = set2, gset3 = set3)
plotVenn(sm_gene_list,
  text_size = 1.5, alpha_degree = 1,
  remove_grid = TRUE)

# if only have five groups
set4 <- paste0(rep("gene", 100), sample(c(1:1000), 100))
set5 <- paste0(rep("gene", 100), sample(c(1:1000), 100))
la_gene_list <- list(gset1 = set1, gset2 = set2, gset3 = set3,
  gset4 = set4, gset5 = set5)
plotVenn(la_gene_list,
  text_size = 15, alpha_degree = 0.2, border_thick = 2,
  remove_grid = TRUE, use_venn = FALSE)

```

##### Enrichment plot

- Support barplot, dotplot

- x-axis support: GeneRatio/Count/FoldEnrich

- stats support: pvalue/p.adjust/qvalue(FDR)

- easily modify plot line & text pattern

```{r enrich_bar1, fig.height = 4}
plotEnrich(ego_bp,plot_type = 'bar',remove_grid = T, main_text_size = 8,
  legend_text_size = 6,border_thick = 1.5)
```
```{r enrich_bar2, fig.height = 4}
plotEnrich(ego_all,plot_type = 'bar', xlab_type = 'GeneRatio',legend_type = 'qvalue',
           remove_grid = T, main_text_size = 8, legend_text_size = 6,border_thick = 1.5)
```

##### Enrichment dotplot

```{r enrich_dot, fig.height = 4}
plotEnrich(ego_bp,plot_type = 'dot',xlab_type = 'GeneRatio',legend_type = 'qvalue',
          remove_grid = T, main_text_size = 8, legend_text_size = 6)
```

```{r enrich_dot2, fig.height = 4}
plotEnrich(ekeg_compare)
```

##### gsea plot

- support: volcano/classic/multi-pathway(fgsea)

```{r gsea, fig.height = 4}
plotGSEA(egsea,plot_type = 'volcano', show_pathway = 3)
plotGSEA(egsea, plot_type = 'classic', show_pathway = c("HALLMARK_UV_RESPONSE_DN","HALLMARK_INTERFERON_ALPHA_RESPONSE"),
         show_genes = c("SELL"))

# default shows top3 up & down pathways
plotGSEA(egsea, plot_type = 'fgsea')
```


### Export 

If you want to export many data sets in one file, you could use `expoSheet`

For example, since we got 100 genes' GO and KEGG result, then we want to export them with gene information:

```{r eval=FALSE}
expoSheet(
  dat_list = list(ginfo, ego_bp, ego_all,ekeg), name_list = list("GeneInfo","GO-BP", "GO-All","KEGG"),
  filename = "gene_enrich.xlsx", dir = tempdir())
```

The result will be:

<img src='man/figures/exp0.png' height="500" alt="exp0"/>
